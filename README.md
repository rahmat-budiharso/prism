# [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)

This version of prism.js is modified to be used in a firefox extension, it's lost its worker capability, and use `window` instead of `self`.
The firefox extension in question is [javascript-view](https://github.com/rahmat-budiharso/javascript-view).

Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).
